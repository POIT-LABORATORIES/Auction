        <p>The word "auction" is derived from the Latin
            <i>auctum</i>, the supine of <i>auge≈ç</i>, "I increase".
            For most of history, auctions have been a relatively
            uncommon way to negotiate the exchange of goods and commodities.
            In practice, both haggling and sale by set-price have been
            significantly more common. Indeed, before the 17th century
            only a few sporadic auctions were held.</p>
